What is class in python?
* it is a blue print which is followd by objects , here every class we have multiple
objects.
* those object will follow the blue print of the particular class.
* here class can have attributes and functions.
  attributes - data
  functions -function
  if we want to access the data and functions with the help of object in a class on python.
              or
* class is a structuer it is used to group the related data along with functionalities 
* it is logical entity
* class wil have collection of variables and methods it is called class members

class declaration
* syntax is
  class <classname>:
        variable declarattion
        method declaration
variable declaration
* we can declared variables in two ways
* in python by defult class variables will be in public
How to declared variables in public
* syntax
  variable = value
  example:
  x=100
How to declared variables in private
* syntax
  __variablename = value
method declaration
* syntax
  def method-name(self):
      or
      function-name
        statements
  examples:
  def hello(self):
      print('hello')
here self implicit reference to access instance variable of class

What is instance variables ?
* if We defined variable in side the class that variables will be called as a instance variabl
* if want to access instance variables in functions with the help of self arugument we can acc

what is object in python ?
* object is a instance of class
* object is a variable of type class
* it is a physical entity
* object will also contains variables and methods
How to create object
* syntax
  objectname = classname()
  eaxample:
  userdefined = classname
How to call method
* syntax
  objectname.methodname
what is variable
* it is a name of storage location
* the variable will be defined within the function or block are called as a local variable
* the scope of local variable is locate the particular function or block
what is global variable
* the variable will be defined outside of any function is called as global variable
* the scope of the global variable we can access the through out the program
* this variable can be accessed by all the functions in the program
What is constructor
* constructor is a special type of method for initializing the instance variable of class
* constructor called automatically when ever object is created
* in complete program constructor will be called onetime only
* by using __init__ we can create constructor
* they are two types of constructors
  default constructor
  parameterised constructor
What is default constructor
* A constructor without parameter or arguments it is called as default constructor
* syntax
  def __init__(self):
      code
  example:
  class add:
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = 100
            self.y = 200
  obj = claname()
  print("addition=",(x+y))
What is parameterised constructor
* A constructor with parameter or arguments it is called as parameterised constructor
* syntax
  def __init__(self,var1,var2):
      code
  example:
  class customer:
        def __init__(self,id,colour):
            self.id=id
            self.colour=colour
  obj = customer(1001,red)

How many types of variable in python class and object conecept
* we have two types of variables
  instance variables
  class variables
How many methods we have in python
* in python we have three types methods
  instance method
  class method
  static method
what is instance variables
* if we defined the variables in side the method that variable will be called instance variabl
What is instance method
* if we are using instance variables then such type of methods called instance method
* if we want to access unique data that we can use instance method
* in insatnce method the first argument is self
What is class variables
* if we define class variables inside the class out side the methods that varibles will be cal
* class variables will be accessed all objects of that class we can access class also.
What is class method 
* to create the class method we need to use class method decorator and in the class method fir
What is static method
* by the help of static method decorator we can create static method this decorator is similar
decorator
* in this static method no need to specify the any parameter it works like a regular function.
